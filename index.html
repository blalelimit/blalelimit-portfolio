<h2>Who I Am</h2>
<p>I am <strong>blalelimit</strong>, an aspiring Data Scientist currently studying Computer Science. 
  To improve my skills, I create programs through Python, Java, and Jupyter Notebook. 
  I engage in the discovery of Machine Learning models, an area I am most interested in. 
  I also enjoy video editing and multimedia processing through Python Image Library (PIL) and FFmpeg.

<h2>What I Do</h2>
<p>I implement tools for understanding data, such as algorithms and models.
  I am fascinated on seeing the relationship and connection between attributes found in data. 
  As a Computer Scientist, I see the importance of critical thinking.
  I also believe that we engage in a lifelong learning.
